### Abstract
In this competition, it provide a dataset which was crawled from Twitter, and also have already labeled the emotion for these tweets by some specific hashtags in the original text. There are 8 classes (or say emotions) in our dataset: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, trust, and joy.

You have to clean the data by doing some pre-processing first. Then, apply feature engineering or any other data mining technique you have or haven't learned in the Data Mining course. The final goal is to learn a model that is able to predict the emotion behind each tweet.
